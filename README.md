Hi!

This is borygo, glad you're here!

This is a simple program that compares the songs you have on your disk to the songs you have on your Soundcloud playlist!

Maybe you know it or not, I'm a beginner DJ and I've been selecting songs for SC a lot lately and that's why I created it, because the program itself shows you which songs are missing on your disk. I hope you will use it in the future and it will serve you well :)

In this program, I used Selenium, Webdriver and difflib. Prints are in polish language and you can also change it if you want but I think that is easy to understand them. 

With using this program you only have to scroll down you all playlist ( if your playlist like mine, is more than 200 songs then you can change the time in program to do all the scroll )
